## Run tweaks from Chris Titus Winutil app with just one click
&nbsp;
The original tool looks like this:

You can run the original program with the following powershell command:

```powershell
irm christitus.com/win | iex
```
Here is the link for the original repository:

I just copy the tweaks from the program, and made them to run with one simple `bat` script.
You can chek out  *[my fork](https://github.com/markagoston/winutil)*.

To use the script *download* the file below and **run it as Administrator**. It will take about *one minute* to run.
